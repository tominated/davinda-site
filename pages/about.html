    After graduating as an Electrical Engineer, David kicked off a
    successful career in Sales and Management in the controls and
    automation space for almost 14 years. This was followed
    by approximately 2 years in the records and document management

    Davinda Innovations represents the next chapter and an opportunity to
    fulfil a long term desire to take a number of ideas, which in some
    cases have been on the drawing board for many years, and turn them
    into saleable and useful items. There are several areas where
    product design and construction will be directed. In broad terms these
    will be product development to improve a family's way of life.
